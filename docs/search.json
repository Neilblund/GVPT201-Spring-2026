    "text": "Step 0: Take a little break\nIn my experience, 99% of errors are the result of stuff like misspelling a variable or forgetting to load a package and they’re completely obvious once you’ve spotted them. There’s no way around this, it happens to everyone. The only real advice I can offer here is: take a break and relax your brain. Go for a walk. Eat a sandwich. Pet a cat, etc. Then come back with a fresh set of eyes and retrace your steps to see if you can spot something that looks out of place.\nOnce you’ve done this, take a look at the offending output and see if you can get any clues about its origins. When you see messages like: Error in foo() : could not find function \"foo\" or Error: object 'x' not found its often either a misspelling or its the result of a variable or function that hasn’t been loaded into R yet.\nOther messages are a little harder to parse, but you can often copy-paste the error into a search engine and you’ll find that other people have gotten help for the same issue. R has a big community of users, and so there’s a good chance that someone else has encountered the same problem you’re having and has written about how to solve it. Similarly, if you’re having an issue with a particular function, consult the help file and see if you can find any useful information there.\nWhen this fails, then move on to step 1.",

Make a new script and call it something like “error_replication” and then try to replicate your error message in as few steps as possible. Remember that you’ll need to re-load any packages or data you’ve been using for your analysis first. For GVPT 201, that usually means at least running library(RCPA3) and possibly loading one of the world, nes, gss or states data sets.\nRun through each line of code one step at a time until you encounter the problem. If you want to be absolutely sure that your code can be replicated, repeat step 1 and then press the “source” button at the top right of the script editor. This will run the entire script in sequence.\nHere’s an example of a common error that comes from trying to use the max function on a variable that isn’t numeric. I might have a lot of other code in my original script, but I only need four lines to replicate this error message and you can easily recreate it yourself by copying these same lines:\n\n# Step 1: After restarting Rstudio and clearing the environment...\n# Step 2: I load the required packages ----\nlibrary(RCPA3)\n# and import the \"world\" data set and assign it to a variable\nworld&lt;-RCPA3::world\n\n# Step 3: And then I recreate my error message----\nmax(world$election.violence.post)\n\nError in Summary.factor(structure(c(1L, NA, 1L, NA, 1L, 2L, 1L, 1L, 1L, : 'max' not meaningful for factors\n\n\nIsolating the problem like this can usually make it a lot easier to spot the source of the issue, but if you can replicate the error and you’re still not sure how to fix it, then its probably time to move on to the next step.",

    "section": "Grade components",
    "text": "Grade components\nGrades are a percentage out of 780 possible points. The points will be distributed as follows:\n\nWorkbook Homework (25%)\nThese will be short assignments from the workbook that you will submit through ELMS. In order to receive credit you must attach an R script that shows your work along with your submission.\nYour lowest assignment grade will be dropped.\n\n\nExams (25%)\nThere will be two open-notes/open book exams administered through ELMS. They will cover materials from the lecture, textbook, and discussion sections. While they aren’t cumulative, concepts from the first half of the course will be relevant to the second half, so there may be some overlap for the second exam.\n\n\nSurvey (35%)\n\nPilot Design\n\nDuring lecture and discussion sections, students will work with me and the TA’s to design a battery of questions. Students will workshop these questions with each other and individually submit questions they would like to see on the survey. The Professor will choose the finals set of questions and program the survey. Once this is complete, the Professor will distribute this draft as the “pilot” survey.\n\nPilot Analysis\n\nPilot analysis: After the pilot survey has been in the field for about a week, the Professor will release the data to the students. Students will have to complete a basic analysis of the pilot data. In addition to the respondents’ answers to the questions, students are asked to consider the instrument itself. Did they find any questions confusing? Offensive? Needlessly complicated? Etc. Based on this feedback, the teaching staff will edit the survey instrument.\n\nVerification of Survey Distribution\n\nOnce the final question wording has been determined, students will be responsible for distributing the survey to as wide a range of people as possible via social networking sites, such as Facebook and Twitter, and other means of communication. You can also post it on websites like Reddit and distribute via email. Students will have to provide proof of distribution in the form of a screenshot. The survey will be in the field for approximately two weeks. Students are expected to promote and distribute the survey during this time.\n\nFinal Write-up\n\nThe final survey write up will be three memos (two “practice” that will take the form of “quizzes” online, and one final one, which will be submitted as a paper) on the data gathered via the class survey. We will provide more detailed guidelines closer to the due dates. The memos are not weighted equally; the last one is weighted most heavily. Grades will be based on consistency of 8 the analytical argument, demonstration of cumulative mastery of the material from the course, and clarity of writing. The detailed rubric for the paper is available on ELMS.\n\n\n\n\nSection Participation (10%)\nSection: Students are expected to have completed all of the assigned readings and homework for each section and be prepared to discuss them. Attendance (in person or via zoom with the camera on) is mandatory and teaching assistants record participation in section.\n(Note that your grade here is based on your participation and engagement. Attendance alone is necessary, but not sufficient for earning full credit.)\n\n\nExperimental Lab (5%)\nThis class will also give credit to students who take part in studies conducted by GVPT faculty and graduate students. Each study will take about 20-30 minutes to complete. If you prefer not to serve as a participant, you may elect to satisfy the requirement by completing an alternate assignment (HW 13). However, you must notify the Research Administrator Woohyeon Kim (whkim@umd.edu) before the last day of schedule adjustment for the semester if you wish to register for the alternate assignment. Students will receive an email with further instructions about participation when the studies are available.\nStudents who are under 18 years of age must obtain parental permission to participate in research. If you are under 18, please contact Jordan James Anthony Spencer jspeck13@umd.edu and he will provide you with instructions on how to participate in the research studies. Alternate assignments cannot be used to make up for a study at the end of the semester.\n\n\nLate work\nBy default, all assignments will be due by 11:59 PM on their respective due dates. Assignments turned in after the deadline will receive a 20% penalty, and an additional 10 percentage points will be deducted for each additional day late.\nThis penalty can be waived if you have a documented excuse such as a doctor’s note, letter from a therapist, court order barring you from doing homework etc.\nFor regular homework assignments, students may provide a one-time self-signed excuse note to receive a 24 hour extension on a non-major grading event such as a homework assignment. See this page for a template. This policy does not apply to exams or the final project.",

So the code below returns and error because x hasn’t been defined yet:\n\nx\n\nError: object 'x' not found\n\n\nTo access xI first need to create it by assigning a value (in this case, some text in quotation marks) to that name. This works just fine:\n\nx&lt;-\"I am a variable\"\n\nx\n\n[1] \"I am a variable\"\n\n\nThe other place this comes up is when you try to access a column from a data set without specifying the data set where that variable exists. For instance, “age” is a column in the nes data, but just typing “age” doesn’t work because R doesn’t know where to look:\n\nmean(age, na.rm=T)\n\nError: object 'age' not found\n\n\nUsing the dataset$varname syntax solves this problem:\n\nmean(nes$age, na.rm=T)\n\n[1] 51.58522",

    "section": "What are factor variables?",
    "text": "What are factor variables?\nA factor variable is R’s default data type for storing categorical data. Technically, a factor is actually just a bunch of integers with a special levels attribute that specifies the labels that those integers correspond to:\n\nexample_factor &lt;- factor(c(1,1,2,2,3,4), labels = c('A', 'B', 'C', 'D'))\nexample_factor\n\n[1] A A B B C D\nLevels: A B C D\n\n\nR can also just store regular text data, but factors have some distinct advantages when working with certain data sources. The most important is that they allow us to control the ordering of tables and graphs. For example, if I make a table with a character variable, R prints the elements in alphabetical order:\n\nstring_vector &lt;- c(\"Disagree\", \"Neither disagree nor agree\", \"Agree\")\ntable(string_vector)\n\nstring_vector\n                     Agree                   Disagree \n                         1                          1 \nNeither disagree nor agree \n                         1 \n\n\nBut alphabetizing this doesn’t make sense because the variable has a clear ordering from disagree to agree. The “levels” attribute on a factor allows me to preserve that ordering:\n\nfactor_vector &lt;- factor(string_vector, \n                        # list of the levels the order I want them to appear: \n                        levels =c(\"Disagree\", \"Neither disagree nor agree\", \"Agree\"))\n\ntable(factor_vector)\n\nfactor_vector\n                  Disagree Neither disagree nor agree \n                         1                          1 \n                     Agree \n                         1 \n\n\nSince each level of a factor also has a numeric value, we can also do things like calculate the median value of an ordered variable:\n\nmedian(as.numeric(factor_vector))\n\n[1] 2",

    "text": "(I’ll be adding stuff to this section as I encounter it)\n\n\nYou’ll typically use a weighting variable when you’re working with survey data. In this course, the nes data set will include a weight variable (wt), but there aren’t any weights for the world or states data sets.\nWeighting is used to make samples more closely resemble a target population.

Keep in mind, however, that these data are still not representative of the general population, so you should acknowledge that this is a non-random sample when you discuss your results.\n\n\n\nYou are not obligated to find statistically significant results. As long as you make a reasonable argument for why your hypothesis is worth testing, this is completely fine. If you do find that your hypothesis isn’t supported, you still need to interpret the coefficients, plot the results etc. you just need to say that you’ve failed to reject the null. In the concluding section of the paper, you would also want to talk about why you think your hypothesis wasn’t supported. A few plausible reasons are: you’re wrong, there’s not enough data, there’s uncontrolled confounding, or the sample is biased. You don’t need to give a definitive explanation, just show you’re thinking about your results and that you understand what it means to reject or not reject the null hypothesis.\n(If you think there’s uncontrolled confounding and it comes from a variable that already exists in the data, you might as well test it! But its entirely possible that there’s some other confounding variable that wasn’t included in the data, in which case its fine to say “I suspect this matters, but I can’t test it”)\n\n\n\nBefore submitting your R-code, its a good idea to double-check and make sure everything runs properly.
