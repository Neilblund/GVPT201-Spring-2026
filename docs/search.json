    "text": "Step 0: Take a little break\nIn my experience, 99% of errors are the result of stuff like misspelling a variable or forgetting to load a package and they’re completely obvious once you’ve spotted them. There’s no way around this, it happens to everyone. The only real advice I can offer here is: take a break and relax your brain. Go for a walk. Eat a sandwich. Pet a cat, etc. Then come back with a fresh set of eyes and retrace your steps to see if you can spot something that looks out of place.\nOnce you’ve done this, take a look at the offending output and see if you can get any clues about its origins. When you see messages like: Error in foo() : could not find function \"foo\" or Error: object 'x' not found its often either a misspelling or its the result of a variable or function that hasn’t been loaded into R yet.\nOther messages are a little harder to parse, but you can often copy-paste the error into a search engine and you’ll find that other people have gotten help for the same issue. R has a big community of users, and so there’s a good chance that someone else has encountered the same problem you’re having and has written about how to solve it. Similarly, if you’re having an issue with a particular function, consult the help file and see if you can find any useful information there.\nWhen this fails, then move on to step 1.",

Make a new script and call it something like “error_replication” and then try to replicate your error message in as few steps as possible. Remember that you’ll need to re-load any packages or data you’ve been using for your analysis first. For GVPT 201, that usually means at least running library(RCPA3) and possibly loading one of the world, nes, gss or states data sets.\nRun through each line of code one step at a time until you encounter the problem. If you want to be absolutely sure that your code can be replicated, repeat step 1 and then press the “source” button at the top right of the script editor. This will run the entire script in sequence.\nHere’s an example of a common error that comes from trying to use the max function on a variable that isn’t numeric. I might have a lot of other code in my original script, but I only need four lines to replicate this error message and you can easily recreate it yourself by copying these same lines:\n\n# Step 1: After restarting Rstudio and clearing the environment...\n# Step 2: I load the required packages ----\nlibrary(RCPA3)\n# and import the \"world\" data set and assign it to a variable\nworld&lt;-RCPA3::world\n\n# Step 3: And then I recreate my error message----\nmax(world$election.violence.post)\n\nError in Summary.factor(structure(c(1L, NA, 1L, NA, 1L, 2L, 1L, 1L, 1L, : 'max' not meaningful for factors\n\n\nIsolating the problem like this can usually make it a lot easier to spot the source of the issue, but if you can replicate the error and you’re still not sure how to fix it, then its probably time to move on to the next step.",

So the code below returns and error because x hasn’t been defined yet:\n\nx\n\nError: object 'x' not found\n\n\nTo access xI first need to create it by assigning a value (in this case, some text in quotation marks) to that name.

For instance, “age” is a column in the nes data, but just typing “age” doesn’t work because R doesn’t know where to look:\n\nmean(age, na.rm=T)\n\nError: object 'age' not found\n\n\nUsing the dataset$varname syntax solves this problem:\n\nmean(nes$age, na.rm=T)\n\n[1] 51.58522",

    "section": "What are factor variables?",
    "text": "What are factor variables?\nA factor variable is R’s default data type for storing categorical data. Technically, a factor is actually just a bunch of integers with a special levels attribute that specifies the labels that those integers correspond to:\n\nexample_factor &lt;- factor(c(1,1,2,2,3,4), labels = c('A', 'B', 'C', 'D'))\nexample_factor\n\n[1] A A B B C D\nLevels: A B C D\n\n\nR can also just store text, but factors have some distinct advantages. The most important is that we can easily control the ordering of a table or graph.\nIf I just have a regular character variable, R will try to list out the levels in alphabetical order:\n\nstring_vector &lt;- c(\"Disagree\", \"Neither disagree nor agree\", \"Agree\")\ntable(string_vector)\n\nstring_vector\n                     Agree                   Disagree \n                         1                          1 \nNeither disagree nor agree \n                         1 \n\n\nBut alphabetizing this doesn’t make sense because it has a clear ordering from disagree to agree. The “levels” attribute allows me to preserve that ordering:\n\nfactor_vector &lt;- factor(string_vector, \n                        # list of the levels the order I want them to appear: \n                        levels =c(\"Disagree\", \"Neither disagree nor agree\", \"Agree\"))\n\ntable(factor_vector)\n\nfactor_vector\n                  Disagree Neither disagree nor agree \n                         1                          1 \n                     Agree \n                         1 \n\n\nThis also means we can easily convert a factor variable to numeric so we can do things like calculate the median value of an ordered variable:\n\nmedian(as.numeric(factor_vector))\n\n[1] 2",

As long as you make a reasonable argument for why your hypothesis is worth testing, this is completely fine. If you do find that your hypothesis isn’t supported, you still need to interpret the coefficients, plot the results etc. you just need to say that you’ve failed to reject the null. In the concluding section of the paper, you would also want to talk about why you think your hypothesis wasn’t supported. A few plausible reasons are: you’re wrong, there’s not enough data, there’s uncontrolled confounding, or the sample is biased. You don’t need to give a definitive explanation, just show you’re thinking about your results and that you understand what it means to reject or not reject the null hypothesis.\n(If you think there’s uncontrolled confounding and it comes from a variable that already exists in the data, you might as well test it! But its entirely possible that there’s some other confounding variable that wasn’t included in the data, in which case its fine to say “I suspect this matters, but I can’t test it”)\n\n\n\nBefore submitting your R-code, its a good idea to double-check and make sure everything runs properly.

Keep in mind, however, that these data are still not representative of the general population, so you should acknowledge that this is a non-random sample when you discuss your results."

    "text": "You are not obligated to find statistically significant results. As long as you make a reasonable argument for why your hypothesis is worth testing, this is completely fine. If you do find that your hypothesis isn’t supported, you still need to interpret the coefficients, plot the results etc. you just need to say that you’ve failed to reject the null. In the concluding section of the paper, you would also want to talk about why you think your hypothesis wasn’t supported. A few plausible reasons are: you’re wrong, there’s not enough data, there’s uncontrolled confounding, or the sample is biased. You don’t need to give a definitive explanation, just show you’re thinking about your results and that you understand what it means to reject or not reject the null hypothesis.\n(If you think there’s uncontrolled confounding and it comes from a variable that already exists in the data, you might as well test it! But its entirely possible that there’s some other confounding variable that wasn’t included in the data, in which case its fine to say “I suspect this matters, but I can’t test it”)"

The best way to do this is: restart R, press little broom icon in the environment pane to make sure you’ve cleared all of the your data out, and then run your script one line at a time and make sure that you don’t see any errors. If you’re not able to reproduce the results in your paper, then you may need to check to make sure you have everything in the right order."
